=head1 NAME

WL::text_cursor_position - Perl binding for text_cursor_position protocol

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use WL::text_cursor_position;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WL::text_cursor_position> is a package generated from Wayland protocol definition
using L<wl-scanner.pl>. It implements L<WL::Base> subclasses with wrappers
for requests, event processing and constants for enums.

It is not indended to be used directly. Instead, see L<WL::Connection> to see
how to obtain the object instances.

To see how to attach event callbacks and issue requests, please refer to
L<WL::Base> base class.

Until proper documentation is finished, please refer to documentation of C
bindings of the generated code (it is intended to be readable) to see what
arguments to give to requests and expect from events.

Please consider this an alpha quality code, whose API can change at any time,
until we reach version 1.0.

=head1 BUGS

The interface documentation for the bindings is lacking.

Only client part implemented, not server.
